About Route 53

What is DNS :

Domain name systems , which transtalets hostnames to ip address for a human.
www.google.com -->> 172.217.18.36 

DNS is the backbone of the internet 
DNS uses the hierarical naming structure like 

                .com
            demo.com
        www.demo.com
        
DNS Registrar : Route 53, Godaddy -->> where you can find or register your domain or purchase your domain 
DNS Records : A, CNAME, MX,TXT, NS
DNS Zone : Where contain all the DNS Records, this is location where it shows how to match your hostname into ip
Nameserver : That actually reoslve the DNS queries 
TLD Domain : .com, .org, .gov, .us, .in
SLD Second level domain: amazone.com, google.com
FQDN Fully qualified Domain name : http://api.www.example.com.

Here . is root of all domain 
     .com - TLD
     example.com - SLD 
     www.example.com - subdomain
 api.www.example.com - domain name 
               http - protocol 
               
 
How to DNS Work:

I have an attahced an image regarding this :


Now let's talk about Route 53 :

Amazone Route 53 : A highly scalable , available, fully managed and authrortative DNS 
   Here Authorartative means - we can update DNS records 
Route 53 is also a domain registrar
DNS port is 53

in Route 53 we will be defining some of DNS records which define how you want to route the traffic for your domain.

Records type :

A - maps hostname into IP4
AAA - maps hostname into IPV6 
CNAME - maps hostname into another hostname
NS - nameserver of the DNS zones


Hosted Zones :

A container  for records that define how to route traffic for a domain or its subdomain 
Public hosted zones : container records that specify how to route traffic on the internet like application.com
private hosted zones : container records that specify how you route the traffice within your VPC your virtual private cloud  like application.internal

You pay $0.50 per month for hosted zones.

Record TTL :

Time to live : means if clinent is requestion for an example.com to DNS, DNS will revert this domain to IP address with TTL.
Let's suppoese TTL is 300 seconds means client duration of 300 seconds will not query to DNS, it will take the address from it's itself.

High TTL : 24 hours ->> less  traffic on route 53
Low TTL : 60sec -->>  a lot more traffic on DNS , it will cost much beacuse it will charg how many request you are doing to route 53

If we say TTL is for 120 seconds and access our domain through our web browser, it will aceess and TTL time will start to decrease as well.
Meanwhile if we change the value of record of that particular domain, and try to access that domain again with new updation, it will not update until that TTL time
doesn't stop and when TTL times end , it will again check and Now you can see your updation on browser.

CNAME and Alias

CNAME : points an hostname to any other hostname 
        only for NON Root domain 
        
Alias : points an hostname to an AWS resources ( app.domain.com => babla.amazonaws.com )
        work for ROOT Domain as well NON-ROOT Domain 
        Free of charge
